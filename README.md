# URL shortener

Implement a URL shortening service using Django in compliance with the requirements below. Use any additional software necessary. DO NOT use any 3rd-party URL shortening services, APIs, or libraries. Format your code according to the PEP8 recommendations (maximum line length is up to you). Document the options you've considered, their trade-offs, and your decisions in the Readme file. Upload your solution to a repo on GitHub. If it's a public repo - just send us the link. If it's a private - invite user [antanas](https://github.com/antanas).

Completing all of the [required] requirements is necessary for passing the test. Satisfying [optional] requirements gives bonus points. Feel free to come up with and implement your own ideas in addition to, or instead of, the [optional] requirements.

While working on this assignment, you are welcome to have fun and over-engineer the hell out of it if you'd like and show off your strengths. If frontend is not your thing, feel free to keep the user interface minimal. Weâ€™ll be mostly focusing on backend solution.

- [ ] It must be impossible to easily identify which of the two given short URLs was generated earlier;
- [ ] If the same long URL is shortened the second time, it must produce a different short URL;
- [ ] Provide a Readme file with instructions on how to run the service;
- [ ] Provide tests covering the core functionality;

### Optional
